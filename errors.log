ERROR {'description': 'This week, I discuss an interesting philosophical perspective on procrastination and the notion of "weakness of will." The content for my discussion comes from a chapter written by Sarah Stroud (McGill University) in "The Thief of Time: Philosophical Essays on Procrastination" (2004: Oxford University Press). I took the title of my podcast from her chapter with the same title. It\'s an interesting topic, and my discussion takes us from the Greek notion of Akrasia up to more recent definitions and understandings of weakness of will. Yes, procrastination is a weakness of will, but there are various issues to consider, particularly this notion of intention.\n\nNEW - My book, The Procrastinator\'s Digest: A Concise Guide to Solving the Procrastination Puzzle, is now available through Amazon and Barnes&Noble at a reduced price! They have agreed to sell the eBook at $2.99, so there is no longer a difference between U.S. and non-U.S. orders (non-U.S. orders should use Amazon, not Xlibris).\n\nHere\'s more about Dr. Stroud taken from "The Thief of Time"Sarah Stroud is Associate Professor of Philosophy at McGill University in Montreal.
